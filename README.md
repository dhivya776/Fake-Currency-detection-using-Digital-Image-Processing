# 🧾 Fake Currency Detection using Digital Image Processing

This project uses **image processing techniques** to detect counterfeit currency notes. It analyzes features from scanned or captured images of currency to determine their authenticity.

## 📌 Features

- Image preprocessing (grayscale, resizing, thresholding)
- Feature extraction (watermarks, microtext, color patterns)
- Machine learning classification to detect fake notes
- Real-time image input via camera or uploaded files
- User-friendly interface using OpenCV / Flask / Streamlit (whichever you used)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (if applicable)
- Flask / Streamlit (if any UI is added)
